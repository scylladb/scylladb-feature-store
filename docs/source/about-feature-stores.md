# Why ScyllaDB for feature stores?
Feature store is a central data store to power operational machine learning models. They help you store transformed feature values in a scalable and performant database. Real-time inference requires features to be returned to applications with low latency at scale. This is where ScyllaDB can play a crucial role in your machine learning infrastructure.

## Why should you consider ScyllaDB as feature store?
ScyllaDB is a real-time NoSQL database that is best suited for feature store use cases where you require low latency (e.g. model serving), high throughout (e.g. training) and need peta-byte scalability.

* **Low-latency**: ScyllaDB can provide <1 ms P99 latency. For real-time machine learning apps, an online feature store is required to meet strict latency requirements. ScyllaDB is an excellent choice for an online store (Read how [Medium is using ScyllaDB](https://medium.engineering/scylladb-implementation-lists-in-mediums-feature-store-part-2-905299c89392) as a feature store.)
* **High-throughput**: Training requires querying huge amounts of data and processing large datasets with possibly millions of operations per second - something that ScyllaDB excels at
* **Large-scale**: ScyllaDB can handle petabytes of data while still keeping latency low and predictable great performance.
* **High availability**: ScyllaDB is a highly available database. With its distributed architecture, ScyllaDB keeps your feature store database always up and running no matter what
* **Easy to migration**: ScyllaDB is compatible with DynamoDB API and Cassandra which means it's simple to migrate over from legacy solutions.
* **Integration with Feast**: ScyllaDB integrates well with the popular open-source feature store framework, Feast. Example architecture with Feast and ScyllaDB:
